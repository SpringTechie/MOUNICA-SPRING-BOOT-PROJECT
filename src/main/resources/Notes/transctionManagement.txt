Transaction Management in spring boot ensures data consistency and integrity by treating a series of operations
as single unit of work.
If any operation  within the Transaction fails, all changes are rolled back.
Spring boot internally supports Transaction Management, meaning we no need to add extra dependency.
How many ways to can achieve Transaction Management?
1.Declarative Transaction Management: is achieved by using @Transactional.
 if we annotate class with this annotation then entire class operation treated as one unit of work.
 if we annotate method with this annotation then entire class operation treated as one unit of work.
To enable Transaction Management we need to add this annotation on main class.

2.Programmatic Transaction Management.
