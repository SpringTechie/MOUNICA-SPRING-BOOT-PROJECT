Spring SPEL.
SPEL stands for Spring Expression Language.
is powerful expression lang used to query and manipulate objects at runtime.
It injects the values dynamically.
By this annotation and expression we can load  property from  application.properties file
Example: @Value("${name}") // this loads the name values from application properties.

By using SPEL we can also perform mathematical operations and method calls.
