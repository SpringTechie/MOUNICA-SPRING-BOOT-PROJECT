Global Exception Handling.
How to handle exception?
By using try catch block or throw or throws keyword.

To handle exception in spring boot we use @ExceptionHandler annotation on top of that method and we mention
what exception it will handle in controller.

By using this controller level exception handling it is only applicable to that controller class.

To solve controller level exception handling we use the Global Exception Handling.

What is Global Exception Handling.?
It is process that allows developers to handle exception occurring across the application in centralized ,
reusable,and structured manner.

This eliminates handling exception in each controller.

Impl:
We no need to add anu dependency.
Create a class and annotate the class with @RestControllerAdvice or @ControllerAdvice
inside that class create methods that handles specific exception and mark that exception with @ExceptionHandler


@ControllerAdvice  :
It is same as component thats defining global Exception logic for multiple controllers
@RestControllerAdvice :
Same as ControllerAdvice but automatically applies response body  to all responses ensuring json response instead of HTML pages.

@ExceptionHandler:
Used to define specific method for handling request.
