Diff ways to create Bean in java?
1.Annotation Based:
Mark the class with @Component, @Service ,@Repository, @Controller, @RestController.
@Service: mark it on class which has business logic.
@Repository: mark it on class which interacts with the repository.
@RestController: mark it on class which has endpoints.
@Component: It is equal to @Service ,@Repository. but mark it on the classes which has does not business logic.
IOC: a framework that manages the lifecycle of application objects (beans) and their dependencies, rather than having the application components manage them themselves.

Two types of container:
1.BeanFactory:
2.ApplicationContext:
Spring automatically detects and registers the bean inside the container.

2.Java Based:
if we want to create any object manually and register this inside the container.
step1: annotate the class with @Configuration(This tells to spring that this class has beans)
step2: create any method that should required bean and mark that method with @Bean.
       By this we can get full control over the object creation.

3.XML Based : we need to create xml files and configure beans inside the xml.
