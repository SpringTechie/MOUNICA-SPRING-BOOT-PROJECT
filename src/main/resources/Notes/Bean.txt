Diff ways to create Bean in java?
1.Annotation Based.
Mark the class with @Component, @Service ,@Repository, @Controller.
Spring automatically detects and registers the bean inside the container.

2.Java Based :
if we want to create any object manually and register this inside the container.
step1: annotate the class with @Configuration(This tells to spring that this class has beans)
step2: create any method that should required bean and mark that method with @Bean.
       By this we can get full control over the object creation.
3.XML Based : we need to create xml files and configure beans inside the xml.
